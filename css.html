    <h2 class="hj">Price:5000 Rs</h2>
	<p class="gh">An air fryer is a small, countertop convection oven that cooks food by rapidly circulating hot air around it, creating a crispy exterior similar to deep-frying but with little to no oil.
 It functions as a compact kitchen appliance that uses a heating element and a fan to generate convection currents, which cook food quickly and evenly.</p>
